    "The players.csv data describes a list of Minecraft players, with each player being an observation. The columns are: experience, subscribed, hashed email, hours played, name, gender, and age. For the purposes of organization, the hashed email could be disregarded for now. Experience level is represented in five categories (beginner, amateur, regular, veteran, pro). Subscribed is a TRUE/FALSE statement, hours played and age are integers, and name and gender seem to be user-entered characters. Gender is user-identified and thus can’t be easily organized in male/female; this makes for a more interesting analysis.\n",

I decided to disregard it for now; of course, it’s still in the original players.csv file, but as I mess around with the data and learn more about it, the hashed email, and maybe even the names, aren’t needed."

A vast majority of observations have hours played values under 1, such that when I looked at the initial table, it was almost all 0-1, with a few values in the 30-40 range every once and a while. I caught on immediately that this would cause some problems with visualization, but quickly decided to use the scale_y_log10() function."

    "Scaled logarithmically, it's easier to see the differences in hours played. From here, it looks like the majority of players have less than an hour of playtime, and only a few have greater than ten hours. From here, it's also easy to see that the data is dominated by male players ages 15-25. However, while younger players seem to have higher hours played, it doesn't look like gender is a very significant determinant. This is something I want to look into further.\n",

My initial thoughts are that age will be the most significant factor, with younger players more likely to contribute. Gender and experience are, interestingly, less significant attributes. My more specific question is, how can gender and experience affect hours played?\n",

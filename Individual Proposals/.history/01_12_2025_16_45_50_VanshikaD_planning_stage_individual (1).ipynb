    "Because the response variable `played_hours` is numeric but the project question is phrased in terms of \"kinds\" of players, I plan to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Treat `played_hours` as a measure of how much data a player contributes.\n",
    "- Use **classification and/or clustering** to group players into types based on their characteristics and play patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some possible approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification:**  \n",
    "  Create categories such as \"high data contributor\" vs \"low data contributor\" based on thresholds of `played_hours`, and then build a classifier using predictors like `experience`, `age`, `gender`, `subscribe`, and aggregated session features (total session duration, number of sessions, average session length).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clustering:**  \n",
    "  Cluster players using the same variables to see if natural groups emerge (e.g., highly active veterans, casual beginners, etc.). This can help interpret what “kinds” of players correspond to heavy data usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data processing and model comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the data into **training (80%)** and **test (20%)** sets.\n",
    "- On the training set, use **cross-validation** (e.g., 5-fold) to compare models and tune hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Evaluate model performance on the held-out test set (e.g., accuracy for classification, or appropriate clustering validation measures).\n",
    "- Compare how much each variable contributes to identifying players who generate large amounts of data.\n",
    "- Use the final model(s) and exploratory plots to answer Question 2: which combinations of experience level, demographics, and session behaviour describe the players who contribute the most data."

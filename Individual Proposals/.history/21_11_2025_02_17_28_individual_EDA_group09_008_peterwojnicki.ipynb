    "I hope to address demand forecasting and use this data to predict highest demand periods for licences and server demand. Since we have the start and end times of the sessions, we can understand which days and times that players start playing the game. Studying these dates and times could offer vital clues when most players will login and when resources should be appropriately allocated to avoid outages and disruption of services.\n",

From the ages histogram we can see that most players are around their early 20s and the average played hours is close to 5.85 hours with some outliers like 259. The data spans from April 6th to September 26 with the average players starting to play around June 24. When investigating the start time histogram (Histogram 1.5), we can see that most players start playing around midnight to 6 am in the morning while barely anyone played from around 9 am to 3 pm.</p>\n",

    "### <u>(4) Methods and Plan</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "I will apply a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) regression using the players and sessions dataset to predict future demands based on past demands. Since kNN is a non-parametric method then we do not need many assumptions about our data since start times for players can be nonlinear and vary throughout different times of the day, holidays, and weekends. Another important assumption is that the future data can be predicted by this data. A linear regression might pose an issue since we cannot guarantee a linear relationship. Therefore, kNN would be more appropriate for predicting a complex nonlinear variable like demand since it is a nonparametric method. A major weakness is that our data only spans around 5 months and we might not be able to account for months outside of April to September. kNN can be slow for larger data sets and we might have to optimize the model for this data. To compare and select the model, we will tune the k-value for RMSE and use a 10 or 5-fold cross validation. For processing of the data we can use 75% of the data for training and 25% for testing. The training data can be used to tune the k-value and then we can calculate the RMPSE for our test data after choosing the optimal k. We will split the data after tidying and wrangling the data for the model. The biggest issue I foresee is choosing what time period to predict (the weekly, hourly, or daily demand) and wrangling the data to avoid biases or errors.\n"

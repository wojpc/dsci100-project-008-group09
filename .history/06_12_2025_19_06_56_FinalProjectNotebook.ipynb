    "## \"Target Profile of Players Who Contribute the Most Data\"\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-indent: 40px;\"> A research group in the Department of Computer Science at UBC is studying how\n",
    "people interact within a virtual environment. To collect data, researchers were able to gather a\n",
    "wide variety of people and put them all into a Minecraft server in order to document their\n",
    "actions. Data that was collected from this experiment included the players name, age, skill level,\n",
    "gender, forum subscription status, hours played and previous experience in the game.\n",
    "Additionally, researchers were also able to collect exact dates and time players logged into and\n",
    "off the Minecraft server. The goal of this research server is to help identify various patterns of\n",
    "engagement between the type of players and the hours spent in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-indent: 40px;\">Although there are many ways to interpret and analyze patterns in the data, we have\n",
    "chosen to target the question of: Which types of players are most likely to contribute to\n",
    "large amounts of data on the Minecraft research server? More specifically, we aim to\n",
    "examine whether certain player characteristics like age, total hours played, and typical session\n",
    "lengths are associated with higher levels of activity inside of the Minecraft server.\n",
    "Understanding the demographic of people who contribute the most with data collection helps us\n",
    "better understand the traits, like age ranges, that could be strongly correlated with higher\n",
    "engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-indent: 40px;\">To address this question we used the players.csv and sessions.csv dataset to see the\n",
    "demographic and behavior related to overall activity levels. The player.csv dataset, contains a\n",
    "total of 196 observations and seven different variables documenting the players age, gender,\n",
    "experience level, hours played and subscription status. The sessions.csv file contains 1535\n",
    "observations and five variables that describe the start and end times of each gameplay session,\n",
    "including timestamps. Using these two files together lets us see both who the players are and\n",
    "how long they actually spent playing, which lets us figure out the type of plays which contribute\n",
    "the most to the data.\n",
